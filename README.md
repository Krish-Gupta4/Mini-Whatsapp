# Mini-Whatsapp
This is a server- client based command line application in order to send and receive messages over a network. Socket programming through python has been the backbone for the chat application. The packets are transferred over the Network layer of the IP/TCP stack and the client side messages are read by the server. I have implemented multithreading to make sure that there is client-client interaction as well. Additional features like SSL protection and encryption are underway and would be implemented in a short while.
The comments have been made with each piece of code simplifying the purpose.
Thanks
